# Inventory Management using Time Series Forecasting
# Project Overview

Managing spare parts inventory in service centers is a critical challenge. Despite high investments, service centers often face stockouts and excess holding costs. This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict demand accurately and enable Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory practices, reducing costs while improving availability.

# Objectives

Forecast demand for spare parts using time series models.

Improve inventory planning and reduce holding costs.

Assist service centers in achieving JIT standards.

# Project Workflow

1. Business Case Understanding – Defined the inventory challenges and forecasting goals.

2. Data Loading & Cleaning – Imported raw inventory demand data and performed preprocessing.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed trends, seasonality, and demand fluctuations.

4. Data Preprocessing – Treated missing values, outliers, and prepared features.

5. Advanced EDA – Investigated correlations and demand drivers.

6. Time Series Analysis – Checked stationarity, decomposed components, and identified patterns.

7. Forecasting Models – Implemented models including:

     ARIMA / SARIMA

     SARIMAX (with exogenous variables)

     Other statistical/ML-based approaches

8.Model Evaluation – Compared models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE.

9. Multivariate Forecasting – Incorporated external factors into SARIMAX for improved accuracy.
