# Inventory-Demand-Forecasting-and-Optimization-using-Time-Series-Analysis
ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management using Time Series Forecasting
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Managing spare parts inventory in service centers is a critical challenge. Despite high investments, service centers often face stockouts and excess holding costs. This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict demand accurately and enable Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory practices, reducing costs while improving availability.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Forecast demand for spare parts using time series models.

Improve inventory planning and reduce holding costs.

Assist service centers in achieving JIT standards.

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

1. Business Case Understanding â€“ Defined the inventory challenges and forecasting goals.

2. Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ Imported raw inventory demand data and performed preprocessing.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Analyzed trends, seasonality, and demand fluctuations.

4. Data Preprocessing â€“ Treated missing values, outliers, and prepared features.

5. Advanced EDA â€“ Investigated correlations and demand drivers.

6. Time Series Analysis â€“ Checked stationarity, decomposed components, and identified patterns.

7. Forecasting Models â€“ Implemented models including:

     ARIMA / SARIMA

     SARIMAX (with exogenous variables)

     Other statistical/ML-based approaches

8.Model Evaluation â€“ Compared models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE.

9. Multivariate Forecasting â€“ Incorporated external factors into SARIMAX for improved accuracy.
